# Insect Antenna and Proboscis Location Tracking

SwarmSight Antenna Tracking module will analyze videos of restrained insects, filmed from the top-down view, and provide the user with the antenna and proboscis tip locations for each frame of the video.

Insect heads filmed from the top-down view can be analyzed by the software. Below is an example setup for filming a honey bee that is delivered an odor stimulus. The bee and its head is restrained from movement, and the camera is positioned above the head on a tripod.

The user positions the Antenna Sensor widget, adjusts the filter, and exclusion zone settings.

The program computes the antenna and proboscis tip locations, and saves the data into a .CSV file that can be opened with most statistical software packages.
