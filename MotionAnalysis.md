##Citation

When using the software in your research, please cite the following publication: [J Birgiolas, CM Jernigan, BH Smith, SM Crook, SwarmSight: Measuring the temporal progression of animal group activity levels from natural-scene and laboratory videos, Behavior Research Methods, 1-12](http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-016-0732-2)

##Analyze Video Motion

SwarmSight provides frame-by-frame motion data from any video. Vary the sensitivity to find just the moving objects you want. Amplify the size of the detected motion to quickly spot fast moving objects. Pick between processing speed or accuracy. You can even restrict to a specific region in the video.

##Compare Motion

Have videos with a control and treatment group? Load their motion activity files and compare the two. SwarmSight will also compare parts of the same video. Just load it twice and pick different times in the video to compare.

##Motion Comparison Statistics

To compare two videos, load the saved video motion data, select the frames to compare, and click "Compute Statistics". You'll get a the results of summary statistics for each frame range and a chart of the average video activity levels.
